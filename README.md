### Other Ways to Boost Your Gameplay Without Spending Money

Apart from the free spins and coins links, here are some other strategies you can use to advance in **Coin Master** without spending real money:

#### 1. **Complete Card Sets**

Card sets are a key feature of **Coin Master**, and completing them unlocks valuable rewards such as spins, coins, and chests. To complete card sets, you need to collect individual cards through spins, raids, and attacks. You can also trade cards with friends to help complete your sets faster.

#### 2. **Raid and Attack Strategically**

Don’t just raid or attack any player’s village randomly. Focus on targets that have a lot of loot available and are likely to give you the coins or cards you need. This will help you maximize the benefits from each raid and attack, leading to faster village upgrades.

#### 3. **Invest in Shields**

Shields protect your village from attacks, which is important for saving your resources. Keep an eye out for shields on the slot machine and use them strategically to protect your progress. It’s better to spend a few coins on shields than to lose valuable resources to an opponent's attack.
